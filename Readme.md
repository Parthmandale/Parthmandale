# Portfolio

I'm a security researcher highly passionate about smart contract security with a proven track record of consistently uncovering vulnerabilities **(100+ HM)** in DeFi protocols and performing at multiple audit contests. 

I've experience in auditing projects in the categories of **Lending-Borrowing, DAO, Cross-Contract chains, Staking/Restaking, Stablecoin, and AMM**. Currently, I'm proficient in auditing Solidity codebases and I'm also trying to learn and audit codebases in different frameworks. 

## Background

In my past job, I first worked as a DevRel for a blockchain-based startup, and later I switched to a different Blockchain-based company as an on-site project intern.

Currently, from Jan 2024 onwards, I'm doing smart contract security learnings and audit contests on different platforms like [sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/), [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), and I'm also open to any potential opportunities.
